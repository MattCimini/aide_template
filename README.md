# aide_template
AIDE_Template is responsible for creating the Fusion 360 models that will take in parameters given by AIDE_Design.
They focus primarily on the geometric relationships within in the plant, as opposed to the hydraulic ones.

 ## Semester Goals
 They plan to have a parameterizable model of the entire plant.
 Meaning the final Fusion file can take in any reasonable range of inputs and output a 3D model of the appropriate plant.
